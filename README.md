# Discord Vanity URL Sniper
Snipe a vanity URL by checking his disponibility every 1 second and claim it when it is available

# Setup
Make sure you have node installed (https://nodejs.org)

To set up the vanity sniper head to https://discord.com/developers/applications and create a new bot client,
copy the token and paste it under "TOKEN" in the config.json file!

Once your token is pasted into the config.json file, make sure to save the file

Run the setup.bat script to set up the script and install the dependancies, 
Then run the start.bat file, and then copy the URL sent to the console to add the bot to your server!

# Commands

#start-snipe <vanity>

#stop-snipe

# Errors

If cmd automatically closes when you run start.bat, make sure you run setup.bat beforehand, and have put your bot token inside config.json
